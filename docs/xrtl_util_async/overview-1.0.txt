Async. execution overview
-------------------------

1. Why?
   a) I've been amazed by .NET delegate asynchronous invocation capabilities (BeginInvoke/EndInvoke).
      It needs compiler support though.
   b) OPC SDK which is a part of XRTL requires async. execution.
      It would be a fatal challenge to manage independent threads since OPC server
      is complicated on its own.
