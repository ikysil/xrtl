Question:
I compile and run OPCDA20Server and OPCDA20Client (launching EXEs, to be
sure...), it's all OK. But if I press the "connect" button in OPCDA20Client,
appear me a windows saying "Interface not supported". What have I forgot?

Answer:
OPCDA20Server and OPCDA20Client was designed to test custom interfaces for
remote configuration. Sorry for misleading names...
In order to make them work you should install
XRTL\src\xrtl_opc_sdk\XRTLOPCDAProxy\Release\XRTLOPCDAProxy.dll using regsvr32.
